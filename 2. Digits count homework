This is the second homework

Total: 100 points: min(100, score)

For this homework you will design and train a convolutional network capable of counting the
digits in an image. You will get a dataset of 5000 training images and 1000 testing images, each
of size 100x100. These images are formed by placing N (1 to 5) digits from the MNIST dataset
(28x28 digits) onto a noisy background. The goal is to predict the number of digits in the image.

You must implement two methods for this task:

Method 1: [50 points]: Without training on the counting dataset.
Just use a model trained to classify images on MNIST dataset. Use this model in a sliding
window approach or by converting it to a fully convolutional network to predict maps
representing the probability of digits being present at that location. Using this maps, with no
additional training estimate the number of digits.

Method 2: [80 points]: Train a new convolutional network to predict the number of digits.
Investigate the usefulness transfer learning by reusing the first part of the classification MNIST
network. Train a model using parameters from the pretrained classification model and a model
with all the parameters randomly initialized.

Your task is to investigate the best network architecture for this tasks, the appropriate loss
(mean square error or cross-entropy), the effect of transfer learning.
