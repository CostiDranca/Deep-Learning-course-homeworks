# Deep-Learning-course-homeworks
This repository contains my homework for the Deep Learning course from BitDefender

There are 4 homeworks:

1. Solve Sudoku using a Feedforward Neural Network
2. Convolutional Neural Network for counting the number of digits in an image, using transfer learning
3. Recurrent Neural Network for classifying code sequences
4. Reinforcement Learning
