# Deep-Learning-course-homeworks
This repository contains my homework for the Deep Learning course from BitDefender

There are 4 homeworks:

1. Solve Sudoku using a Feedforward Neural Network
2. Convolutional Neural Network for counting the number of digits in an image, using transfer learning
3. Recurrent Neural Network for classifying code sequences
4. Reinforcement Learning

The code was implemented with the big help of professors (the BitDefender AI team https://bit-ml.github.io/).
Homeworks were coded in google colaboratory, these files contains only the cells I had to write/modify, not all cells are included.
